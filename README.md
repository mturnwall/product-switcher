# Vue.js Product Switcher

Just a project to help learn Vue.js better. It's just a basic product switcher like the ones you see on sites where there are different versions of products such as different colors.

I wanted to see if Vue.js could be used along with another static template system. I used [nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) for template system. I did this because I wanted to see how hard it would be to add Vue.js to an existing site to be used to handle parts or a certain UI feature of a site.

The demo can be [seen here](http://projects.turnwall.net/product-switcher/dist/)
